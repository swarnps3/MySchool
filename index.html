                <h2>BRIEF HISTORY</h2>
                <p>UPS Segnaputtha Composite was born in 1960s. The constant request of the people of the place and the absence of a school in the village paved way for starting a school on a 1 acre land in the village which was later expanded in coming years. The idea for establishment of school was supported by government officials and local people as well. Within a short period of time it grew to a full-fledged and well developed school. The school has been affiliated to UP Board since its establishment and remains under the scrutiny of Govt. of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
